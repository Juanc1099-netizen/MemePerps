# 📜 MemePerps — Decentralized Futures for the Meme Economy

## Abstract
MemePerps ($MPERP) is the first decentralized protocol on Solana allowing perpetual trading of memecoins.  
It merges the volatility and social energy of memes with a robust DeFi architecture that rewards participation and burns supply.

MemePerps represents a bridge between **culture and code**, **community and capital**, **humor and serious finance**.

---

## 1️⃣ Vision
To become the **global hub for memecoin perpetuals**, where traders can speculate on viral tokens while communities control their own markets.  

> “From chaos to charts. From memes to markets.”

---

## 2️⃣ The Problem
Memecoins dominate the narrative but lack serious trading infrastructure.  
Existing DEXs ignore them, and centralized futures platforms restrict listings.  

Memecoin projects have no way to:
- Provide on-chain leveraged exposure.
- Monetize their own volatility.
- Incentivize liquidity in a decentralized way.

---

## 3️⃣ The Solution
MemePerps introduces **a permissionless perpetuals engine** focused exclusively on meme assets.  
Creators pay a **membership fee in $MPERP** to list their token; traders can then open long or short positions, and the system automatically burns part of every interaction.

Each trade, listing, or fee contributes to a **deflationary loop** that sustains token value and governance participation.

---

## 4️⃣ Core Components
- **Listing Contract:** Verifies eligible meme tokens ($1M+ MC).
- **Perpetuals Engine:** Manages long/short positions with adjustable leverage.
- **Oracle Layer:** Uses Pyth + Switchboard for real-time pricing.
- **Treasury DAO:** Redistributes revenue & executes burns.
- **AI Insights:** Measures sentiment & predicts volatility patterns.

---

## 5️⃣ Market Mechanics
- Traders can open **1x–10x leverage** on memecoins.  
- Funding rates keep longs/shorts balanced.  
- Automatic liquidations via smart contracts.  
- Listing fees burn $MPERP; trades redistribute to LPs.

---

## 6️⃣ Governance & DAO
Each staked $MPERP = 1 vote.  
Community decides:
- Which tokens can be listed.
- What leverage caps exist.
- Treasury allocation.
- Burn ratios and dev incentives.

DAO smart contracts are open-source and audited on Solana.

---

## 7️⃣ Long-Term Vision
MemePerps aims to become the **NASDAQ of meme tokens**, building a reliable market where hype and finance coexist sustainably.

> “Trade the hype. Control the chaos.”
