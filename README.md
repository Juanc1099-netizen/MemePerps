## 1️⃣ Vision  
To become the **global hub for memecoin perpetuals**, where community-driven assets gain the same trading tools as major cryptocurrencies — but with the fun and creativity of meme culture.

---

## 2️⃣ Problem  
Memecoins are explosive cultural phenomena, yet lack proper financial infrastructure:
- No decentralized markets for leveraged exposure.  
- No standardized listing for memecoin futures.  
- Centralized exchanges ignore smaller meme projects.  

---

## 3️⃣ Solution  
MemePerps introduces a **permissionless perpetuals engine** where:
- Meme tokens can be listed once they reach $1M market cap.  
- Traders can open **long/short positions**.  
- Listing fees and trades automatically burn $MPERP.  
- AI modules predict meme trends and volatility.  

---

## 4️⃣ Core Components  
- **Listing Contract** — verifies eligible meme tokens.  
- **Perpetuals Engine** — supports leverage and liquidations.  
- **Oracle Layer** — powered by Pyth and Switchboard.  
- **Treasury DAO** — redistributes fees and controls burns.  
- **AI Insights** — measures sentiment and trading hype.  

---

## 5️⃣ Market Mechanics  
- Leverage: up to 10x.  
- Dynamic funding rates maintain market balance.  
- Every trade contributes to a burn + LP redistribution model.  

---

## 6️⃣ Governance  
$MPERP holders stake and vote on:
- New meme listings.  
- Leverage caps.  
- Treasury allocations.  
- Burn ratio adjustments.  

---

## 7️⃣ Long-Term Vision  
MemePerps aims to become the **NASDAQ of meme tokens** — a decentralized market that transforms community enthusiasm into structured, sustainable opportunity.  
Built entirely on **Solana**, it ensures high speed, low cost, and transparency.

> “Trade the hype, but respect the risk.”

# 💰 $MPERP Tokenomics

## Overview  
$MPERP is the utility and governance token that powers the MemePerps ecosystem.  
Every listing, trade, and action on the platform consumes and burns $MPERP, creating a deflationary economy.

| Category | % | Tokens | Description |
|-----------|---:|---:|-------------|
| 🔥 Burn / Utilities | 50% | 500,000,000 | Used for trading fees, burns, and memberships |
| 💡 Dev / Liquidity | 25% | 250,000,000 | Protocol development, liquidity pools |
| 👥 Community / Rewards | 15% | 150,000,000 | Incentives, staking rewards |
| 🚀 Team / Ecosystem | 10% | 100,000,000 | Team allocation, ecosystem growth |

---

## 🔄 Deflationary Mechanics  
Every action inside MemePerps burns a portion of $MPERP:

|---------|-----|---------|----------------|
| Listing | 100% | 80% | 20% to Dev Pool |
| Trade | 100% | 50% | 50% to LP Pool |

# 📊 Economics Deep Dive

### Supply Simulation  
At 50k trades/month × 2,000 $MPERP fee:  
→ 100M $MPERP used → 60M burned monthly 🔥  
This means 720M tokens (~72% of supply) could be burned in a year of active use.

### Treasury Dynamics  
Unburned 40% redistributed as:  
- 50% Liquidity incentives  
- 30% Development fund  
- 20% AI analytics & partnerships  

### Network Effect  
More trades → higher burn → increased scarcity → stronger token floor.
